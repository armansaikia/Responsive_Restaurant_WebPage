# üíª During this project I have learned------

- How to structure the web page using HTML tags and elements.

- Gained knowledge of CSS styling to enhance the appearance of the website.

- Utilized Bootstrap5 to create a responsive and mobile-friendly layout for the restaurant website.

- Implemented a navigation bar using Bootstrap's navbar component to create a menu for easy website navigation.

- Integrated a carousel component to showcase testimonials or reviews.

- Implemented javascript for :

  Scroll Animation: When the user scrolls down the page, the navigation bar changes its appearance. 

  Navigation Bar Hide:When a navigation link is clicked, it removes the "show" class from the navbar collapse element, hiding the navigation menu.

  Counter Design- The counter design code animates numbers on elements from start to end values over a specified duration in one line.

- Flex box and grid usage.

- Implementation of media query.
